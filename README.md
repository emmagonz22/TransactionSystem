# Venmito Data Engineering Project

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to this data engineering project for Venmito. We're excited to see how you tackle this challenge and provide us with a solution that can bring together disparate data sources into an insightful and valuable resource.

Venmito is a company with several data files in various formats. Our goal is to organize all of this information to gain insights about our clients and transactions. We believe that there is an immense value hidden in these data files, and we are looking for a solution that can help us extract and utilize this value.

We have five files:

- `people.json`
- `people.yml`
- `transfers.csv`
- `transactions.xml`
- `promotions.csv`

Each of these files contains different pieces of information about our clients, their transactions, transfers and promotions.

Your task is to develop a solution that can read these files, match and conform the data, and provide a way to consume this data.

## Requirements

1. **Data Ingestion**: Your solution should be able to read and load data from all the provided files. Take into account that these files are in different formats (JSON, YAML, CSV, XML).

2. **Data Matching and Conforming**: Once the data is loaded, your solution should be able to match and conform the data across these files. This means identifying common entities, resolving inconsistencies, and organizing the data in a unified format.

3. **Data Output**: The final component of your solution should provide a way for us to consume the newly organized data. This could be through a command line interface (CLI), a database with structured schemas, a GUI showing interactive visualizations, a RESTful API, or any other method that you think would be appropriate for a company like Venmito.

4. **Code**: Your solution should be well-structured and easy to understand. Please include comments where necessary. The code will be part of the final deliverable.

## Deliverables

- Source code.
- A README file that describes your solution, your design decisions, and clear instructions on how to run your code.
- A method to consume the data.

## Instructions for Submission

1. Complete your project as described above within your fork.
2. Write a detailed README file that explains your approach, the technologies you used, and provides clear instructions on how to run your code.
3. Submit your project by creating a pull request to this repository.

We look forward to seeing your solution!

Thank you,

Venmito
